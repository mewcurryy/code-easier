## Usage

Sign up or log in to access courses. Navigate lessons in each course and complete them to earn XP. Check your daily missions for extra rewards and keep track of your achievements.

## Daily Quests

Daily quest documents live in the `missions` collection. Each document should contain the following fields:

- `Description` – quest description
- `Requirements` – quest unlock detail -> action and amount
- `title` – quest title
- `id` – quest id
- `type` – usually set to `"daily"`
- `xpReward` - given xp

Each document's **Firestore document ID** must match the quest's `id` so that progress correctly links with the IDs defined in `DAILY_QUEST_IDS`.

Example document:

```json
{
  "description": "Complete any lesson today.",
  "requirements": {
    "action": "lesson_complete",
    "amount": 1
  },
  "title": "Finish a Lesson",
  "id": "dq002",
  "type": "daily",
  "xpReward": 15
}
```

Daily quest progress resets every day when a new set of quests is assigned.

## Achievements

Achievement documents live in the `achievements` collection. Each document should contain the following fields:

- `criteria` – object describing the unlock condition (e.g. type and value)
- `description` – short explanation of the achievement
- `icon` – URL for the achievement icon
- `id` – achievement id
- `title` – achievement title
- `xpReward` – XP awarded on unlock

Each document's **Firestore document ID** must match the achievement's `id` so progress links correctly with `ACHIEVEMENT_IDS`.

Example documents:

```yaml
- criteria:
    type: "completion"
    value: 1
  description: "Complete Profile"
  icon: "https://placehold.co/50x50/quiz.png"
  id: "ach001"
  title: "Known Legend"
  xpReward: 30

- criteria:
    type: "completion"
    value: 1
  description: "Complete your first lesson!"
  icon: "https://placehold.co/50x50/achieve1.png"
  id: "ach002"
  title: "First Lesson"
  xpReward: 20
```
